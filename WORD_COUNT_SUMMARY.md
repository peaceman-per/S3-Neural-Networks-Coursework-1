### Methodology

The word count was calculated by:
- Extracting all markdown cells from the notebook
- Removing code blocks (inline and fenced)
- Removing tables, figures, and plots
- Removing URLs and image syntax
- Removing markdown formatting characters
- Counting remaining words

This method aligns with the assignment requirement that excludes "code, tables, plots, figures and references" from the word count.
