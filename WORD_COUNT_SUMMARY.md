### Suggestions for Reduction
1. Review and condense verbose explanations
2. Remove redundant statements
3. Streamline technical descriptions
4. Combine similar discussion points
5. Use more concise language where possible

### Methodology

The word count was calculated by:
- Extracting all markdown cells from the notebook
- Removing code blocks (inline and fenced)
- Removing tables, figures, and plots
- Removing URLs and image syntax
- Removing markdown formatting characters
- Counting remaining words

This method aligns with the assignment requirement that excludes "code, tables, plots, figures and references" from the word count.
