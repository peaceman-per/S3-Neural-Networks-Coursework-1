- **Status:** Not implemented at all
- **Required:**
  - Select best model from Section 7 grid search
  - Train final model on combined train + validation data
  - Evaluate on test set
  - Report and discuss results

### Issue #2: Word Count EXCEEDS Limit ❌
- **Current:** 4,004 words
- **Maximum:** 3,000 words
- **Overage:** 1,004 words (33% over limit)
- **Warning:** Assignment states "Submissions exceeding this limit will not be marked"

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

Your coursework demonstrates excellent work in Sections 1-7:

- ✅ **Section 1-7:** All complete and well-executed (87.5% of assignment)
- ✅ **Technical Implementation:** Modern TensorFlow practices, GPU optimization
- ✅ **Analysis Quality:** Thorough experimentation and clear visualizations
- ✅ **Documentation:** Professional presentation with good structure
- ✅ **Grid Search:** Systematic hyperparameter tuning in Section 7

---

## 🎯 Quick Action Plan

### Priority 1: Add Section 8 (1-2 hours)
```
1. Load grid_search_results.csv
2. Identify best hyperparameters
3. Create and train final model on train+val data (50,000 samples)
4. Evaluate on test set (10,000 samples)
5. Write discussion (~200-250 words)
```

### Priority 2: Reduce Word Count (2-3 hours)
Target reductions:
- **Section 7:** Cut ~450 words (1,168 → ~700 words)
- **Section 5:** Cut ~180 words (828 → ~650 words)
- **Section 1:** Cut ~130 words (627 → ~500 words)
- **Section 4:** Cut ~100 words (455 → ~350 words)

### Priority 3: Minor Fixes (15 minutes)
- Fix 4 spelling errors
- Generate HTML export
- Final review

**Total Time Required: 4-6 hours**

---

## 📈 Grading Impact

### Current Risk
- **May not be marked** due to word count violation
- **Missing 10%** from Section 8
- **Estimated:** 0-77/100 (at risk)

### With Fixes Applied
- **Estimated:** 80-90/100
- **Grade Band:** First Class (70+)
- **All requirements met**
